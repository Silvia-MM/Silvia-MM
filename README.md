About Me
I'm SÃ­lvia, a dynamic professional with a background in Business Analytics and Strategy. With experience in both B2B and B2C markets, I've navigated the ever-changing landscapes of the traveling and gambling industry, where I honed my skills in CRM and analytics using Excel (a lot of Power Pivot), and Power BI. Currently, I'm supercharging my expertise by pursuing a postgraduate course in Data Science & Business Analytics at ISEG Lisbon. Passionate about data and analysis, I thrive on uncovering insights, solving complex problems, and optimizing data quality to drive business success.

I am always eager to help others succeed, and work in new projects. Don't hesitate to ask questions or share your insights â€“ together, we can unlock the power of data!
